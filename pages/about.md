Hi, I'm Sb!

I'm an artist and data scientist living in New York City with over 10 years of experience in operations and production strategy. I've learned a lot through the many lives I've lived and I'm always super excited to share insights with team mates or other inquiring minds. 

Personally and professionally, I take very seriously the responsibility of bringing feeling and strategic resolution to shared challenges. With experience in advanced applications of analytics, computer vision, machine learning, and the internal dynamics of prestige art and research institutional environments, I have a history and passion, through direct and open communication, for bringing measured clarity to the shared objectives of leading organizations.

I'm ever curious and passionate about learning new things and, in the coming months, a lot of that exploration will end up here. Please feel free to poke around the different projects and links within this portfolio to see current and past projects that I'm thinking through and please feel free to reach me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sb-fuller-studio){:target="_blank"} with any comments or questions. 
No one is an island!
